First we'll need to have vagrant installed, assuming you have ruby installed go
ahead and install vagrant by going out to http://vagrantup.com/ and downloading
the package.

You can also install it as a gem with:

$ gem install vagrant


Next we need to generate the initial Vagrant file

$ vagrant init


To build out our word press blog install let's get our application server setup.
